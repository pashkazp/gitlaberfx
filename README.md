# GitLaberFX: Branch Manager for GitLab

**GitLaberFX** is an open-source desktop application created for developers and team leads to effectively manage repositories in GitLab. It provides powerful tools for bulk cleaning and organizing branches, helping to maintain order in projects and simplify workflows.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Projects and Branches Overview:** Easily browse all projects and branches available to you.

- **Merge Analysis:** Automatically check which branches have already been merged into your target branch (e.g., `master` or `develop`).

- **Safe Archiving:** Instead of irreversible deletion, move outdated branches to an archive (e.g., `archive/feature/task-123`), preserving their history. The archive prefix can be customized.

- **Flexible Deletion:** Completely remove unnecessary branches.

- **Powerful Filtering:** Use **regular expressions (RegExp)** for instant bulk selection or exclusion of branches by mask (e.g., `feature/*`, `hotfix-*`).

- **Batch Operations:** Perform operations (deletion/archiving) for:

   - Manually selected branches.

   - Old merged branches (older than a specified date).

   - Old unmerged branches.

- **Interactive UI:** The interface instantly responds to your actions, updating the state locally without unnecessary server requests.

- **Multilingual Support:** English and Ukrainian languages with dynamic switching capability.

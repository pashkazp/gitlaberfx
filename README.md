# GitLaberFX: Branch Manager for GitLab

**GitLaberFX** is an open-source desktop application created for developers and team leads to effectively manage repositories in GitLab. It provides powerful tools for bulk cleaning and organizing branches, helping to maintain order in projects and simplify workflows.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Projects and Branches Overview:** Easily browse all projects and branches available to you.

- **Reliable Merge Analysis:** Accurately determine which branches have been merged into your target branch (e.g., `master` or `develop`) by checking if the last commit of the source branch exists in the target branch history.

- **Safe Archiving:** Instead of irreversible deletion, move outdated branches to an archive (e.g., `archive/feature/task-123`), preserving their history. The archive prefix can be customized.

- **Flexible Deletion:** Completely remove unnecessary branches.

- **Powerful Filtering:** Use **regular expressions (RegExp)** for instant bulk selection or exclusion of branches by mask (e.g., `feature/*`, `hotfix-*`).

- **Advanced Date Filtering:** Filter branches based on their last commit date using "before" and "after" criteria, allowing for precise selection of branches based on their age.

- **Batch Operations:** Perform operations (deletion/archiving) for:

   - Manually selected branches.

   - Old merged branches (older than a specified date).

   - Old unmerged branches.

- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures data integrity with automatic rollback mechanisms for failed operations, preventing partial state changes that could lead to inconsistencies. Enhanced logging of branch commit information improves traceability and aids in recovery if needed.

- **Interactive UI:** The interface instantly responds to your actions, updating the state locally without unnecessary server requests.

- **Multilingual Support:** English and Ukrainian languages with dynamic switching capability.
